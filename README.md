# autokattis

Kattis scraper, updated as of May 2023 after the major UI/UX change.

## Usage

1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the Python packages required.
1. Create a new file called `env.py` and add these two lines.

    ```python
    USER = <username>
    PASSWORD = <password>
    ```

    where `<username>` is your Kattis username/email and `<password>` is your Kattis account password. Both should be provided as **Python strings**. See `env.py.example` for example.
1. Run `python main.py`.
